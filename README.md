# vCard to CSV Converter

This Python script provides functionality to convert vCard (`.vcf`) files into CSV files, enabling easier management of contact data.

## Features

1. **Fix vCard files**: The script handles vCard files that split long lines across multiple lines with an equals sign (`=`). It combines these lines into a single line in a new vCard file.

2. **Convert vCard to CSV**: The script reads the fixed vCard file and writes the contact information into a CSV file. The CSV file includes columns for the contact's name, email address, phone number, and any other fields present in the vCard file.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have the required Python package installed by running:
   `pip install vobject`
2. Run the script with your vCard and output CSV file paths:
   `python vcf2csv.py input.vcf output.csv`

## Limitations and Possible Improvements

- The script expects filenames as command-line arguments, so provide both the input vCard and output CSV paths when running it.
- The script uses the `ISO-8859-9` encoding to handle Turkish characters. If the vCard file contains characters from different languages, you may need to adjust the encoding.
- The script currently ignores photos in the vCard file. If your vCard files include photos and you want to process them, you will need to extend the script.
- The script assumes that fields like name, email, and phone number exist in the vCard file and are of a certain type. If your vCard files have different fields or data types, you may need to adjust the script.
